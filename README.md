**`Professional Summary`**

As a detail-oriented and proactive Risk Monitoring Specialist Intern, I leverage my academic background and practical experience in Risk Management and Financial Analysis. At McDonald's Head Office, I contribute to risk management processes by designing and maintaining documentation, conducting risk assessments, and providing actionable insights to stakeholders.

My role involves analysing financial data, internal reports, and transactions to identify and mitigate potential risks. I focus on pinpointing risk root causes and ensuring timely corrective actions aligned with company standards. This experience has strengthened my ability to manage both proactive and reactive risk responses, essential for organizational stability.

I hold a Postgraduate Diploma in Risk Management and a Bachelor of Commerce in Mathematical Sciences, with expertise in Operational Risk, Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC), Risk Financing, Market Risk, and Credit Risk. This academic foundation has equipped me to tackle complex financial risks, preparing me for greater challenges, such as those at the South African Reserve Bank.
